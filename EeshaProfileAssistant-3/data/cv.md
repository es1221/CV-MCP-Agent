     WORK EXPERIENCE

 Sept 2021 - July 2025

 Sept 2015 - Jul 2021

Butterfly Air, AI Solutions Engineer and Product Manager

Mar 2024 - Jun 2025

Independently developed a custom AI-driven time series forecasting model using NeuralProphet, fusing
autoregressive methods with neural networks to predict indoor air quality metrics with state-of-the-art
~94% accuracy over a 12-hour forecast window.
Collaborated with cross-functional teams, including software developers to optimise and implement AI
functionalities, and meet client needs.
Designed and implemented a language model (LLM) - ChatGPT, to analyse forecast data and provide
actionable insights, aligning AI development with user experience goals.
Built an AI Agent using a Retrieval Augmented Generation model implemented through LangChain with
no hallucinations.
Evaluation of the features using the RAGAS framework and k-fold cross-validation for the AI Agent and
Forecasting model respectively.

Mastercard, Product Management Internship

Jun 2023 - Sept 2023

Collaborated with the Partnerships Product Management team to analyse and optimise the integration of
Mastercard's payment gateway with key fintech partners.
Gained in-depth knowledge of payment gateway operations, contributing to the enhancement of fintech
solutions across global partnerships.

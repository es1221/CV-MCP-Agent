    "description": "Design engineers are problem solvers who bridge the gap between traditional engineering and design to create innovative solutions to modern challenges, from improving passenger comfort on commercial airlines to designing next-generation sports prostheses. It's a highly creative discipline that draws on knowledge of product development, human centred design, technical design and rapid prototyping to bring new innovations to market, and to improve existing products and the processes used for making them. This gives design engineers a unique perspective on the entire product lifecycle, from concept to production and beyond. This systems thinking can be applied to many disciplines including AI and ML which is where Eesha has specialised in her masters project."
